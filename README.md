# Logistic Regression Implementation

## Project Overview

This repository contains implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch using Python. The aim of this project is to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the Logistic Regression algorithm and its application on a specific dataset.

## Features

- **Custom Logistic Regression Model**: Implementation of logistic regression without using high-level libraries like scikit-learn.
- **Dataset Analysis**: Detailed exploration and analysis of the dataset used.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics like **accuracy** to assess the performance of the implemented model.
